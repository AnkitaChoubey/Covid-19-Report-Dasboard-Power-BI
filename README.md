# Covid-19-Report-Dasboard

## Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze global Covid-19 data to track confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases across countries and WHO regions. The goal is to provide a clear, interactive view of the pandemic’s impact, identify the most affected regions, and monitor weekly changes to support data-driven health and policy decisions.

  
## Questions (KPIs):

- What is the total number of deaths, recoveries, active cases, and new cases globally?
- Which countries have the highest death tolls?
- Which WHO regions report the highest number of new cases?
- What is the percentage increase in cases over the last week by WHO region and by country?
- Which countries and regions have the highest confirmed vs. active case counts?
- How do deaths and recoveries compare across countries?

 


## Process:
- Collected the global Covid-19 dataset containing country/region-level case and death statistics.
- Cleaned and formatted the dataset by handling missing values and ensuring consistency in numeric and date fields.
- Modeled the data in Power BI for accurate relationship mapping and visualization.
- Defined KPIs including total deaths, recoveries, active cases, new cases, and weekly percentage increase.
- Created interactive visuals (bar charts, line graphs, donut charts) to display deaths, recoveries, active cases, and weekly changes.
- Filtered data by Country/Region and WHO Region for dynamic analysis.
- Published a Covid-19 report dashboard for easy interpretation of the pandemic’s global status.

## Project Insights
- Total deaths: 654K
- Total recovered: 9M
- Total active cases: 6M
- Total new cases: 229K
- Highest deaths by country: US (56K), India (44K), Brazil (23K), Peru (14K)
- Highest new cases by WHO region: Americas (130K), South-East Asia (49K), Europe (22K)
- Highest 1-week % increase by WHO region: Eastern Mediterranean (34.12%), Africa (22.46%), Americas (17.1%)
- Highest 1-week % increase by country: Papua New Guinea (28.1%), Gambia (17.58%), Bahamas (8.51%)
- Recovery rates are significantly higher than death rates in most countries.

## Final Conclusion
- Americas and South-East Asia lead in new Covid-19 case counts.
- US, India, and Brazil are the most impacted in total deaths.
- Emerging hotspots in smaller nations require urgent attention.
- High recovery rates are encouraging, but persistent active cases show the pandemic is still ongoing.
- Continuous monitoring and preventive measures remain essential worldwide.
